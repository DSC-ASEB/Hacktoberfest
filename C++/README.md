### What is C++ (C plus plus)?

**C++ is a computer programming language** created in 1983 by **Bjarne Stroustrup**. The C++ programming language acts as an extension to the modern C language known as standard C. C++ is known as an intermediate (low-level) language for programmers to learn. Writing data types modules in C++ can be used to extend the capabilities of python too.
