# Inventory Management System
An inventory management system (or inventory system) is the process by which you track your goods throughout your entire supply chain, from purchasing to production to end sales. It governs how you approach inventory management for your business. Every business has an Inventory Management System including small shops

## Details 
This repository contains a python notebook for the Inventory Management System. This inventory has a total of 31 different types of products and each product has a unique ID. There are 5 attributes for each product which are: Product name, Brand, Quantity, Category and Date of Expiry. All the products and their attributes are stored in Records.json

A customer can purchase any product of his/her choice from the menu. After the purchase, Records.json is updated and a bill is generated which contains the details of the purchased product, discount and the amount paid. These bill details along with the time of purchase are written to Sales.json file to keep a track of sales.


Thank You.
