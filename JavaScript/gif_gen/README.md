# GIF Generator

- This project uses basic HTML/CSS/JS to create a basic user interface to create a GIF generator
- We use GIPHY API to get GIFs searched by the user
- The user can search for a particular gif in the search bar and a result will be displayed below
- The user can explore different searches using this interface
- Here I used a private api key of my own you can go to this URL to create your own [API key](https://developers.giphy.com/)
