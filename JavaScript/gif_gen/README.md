# GIF Generator
- This project uses basic html/css/js to create a basic user interface to create a gif generator.
- We use the **giphy api** to get the gifs searched by the user
- The user can search for a particular gif in the search bar and a result will be displayed below.
- The user can explore different searches using this interface.
- Here I used a private api key of my own you can go to this url to create your own [api key](https://developers.giphy.com/)
